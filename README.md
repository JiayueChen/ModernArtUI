===========

> Inspired by work of Sol LeWitt for visual design and user interaction is added.

#### Things needed to do
1. Add whole colors in [Material Design of colors](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-ui-color-palette) in `res/values/colors.xml` (followed by certain pattern).
2. Adjust weight and background colors of `TextView` in `res/layout/activity_main.xml`, using reference in `colors.xml`.
3. Be aware of task marks in `colors.xml` and `activity_main.xml`, remove it when you finish it.
4. Use given material design to create wonderful visual effect.
